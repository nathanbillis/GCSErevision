      <li><strong><u>What was the reason for the Flood? (4marks) </u></strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Some people thought that the boscastle floods were caused by global warming and others thought it was cause by the Hurricane Bonny, but there has been no proof that either of this was the cause for the large amount of rainfall in a few hours. People may have the conception that it was the hurricane that caused the flood because in 1996 hurricane lili was the cause of a major flood like this. But the real reason for the floods was the high sided valley the village was placed in and the small drainage basin which cause difficulty to extract the water quickly. Also the warm air picking up evaporated water from the atlantic ocean, reaching the uk and clashing with the cool air causing rapid condensation over Cornwall. These enhanced water levels cause the large amount of rainfall in a few hours. </li>
